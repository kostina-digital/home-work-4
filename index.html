            Chess notation systems are used to record either the moves made or the position of the pieces in a game of
            chess. Chess notation is used in chess literature, and by players keeping a record of an ongoing game. The
            earliest systems of notation used lengthy narratives to describe each move; these gradually evolved into
            more compact notation systems. Algebraic notation is now the accepted international standard, with several
            variants. Descriptive chess notation was used in English- and Spanish-language literature until the late
            20th century, but is now obsolescent. Portable Game Notation (PGN) is a text file format based on English
            algebraic notation which can be processed by most chess software. Other notation systems include ICCF
            numeric notation, used for international correspondence chess, and systems for transmission using Morse code
            over telegraph or radio. The standard system for recording chess positions is Forsyth–Edwards Notation
            (FEN).
