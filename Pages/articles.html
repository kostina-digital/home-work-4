                The role of chess in the development of children-parents’ perspectives

                <strong>
                    Introduction
                </strong>
                The study examines the role of chess in the development of children from the perspectives of parents.
                The research focused on analyzing the parents’ perceptions about chess’s role in their children’s
                development, on finding out how the perception of parents differs depending on whether they know how to
                play chess or not, and on outlining the profile of the parents whose children play chess.The study was
                conducted in Romania.<br>
                <strong>Methods</strong>
                In order to conduct the study, a quantitative research method was used, while having as a research
                instrument a non-standardized questionnaire. The questionnaire was applied to parents of chess-playing
                children who are members of chess clubs from Romania. The sample of the study comprises 774
                respondents.<br>
                <strong> Results</strong>
                The results of our research showed that parents are of the opinion that chess helps children develop
                their cognitive abilities, their character and their competitive spirit. Most of the parents focused on
                highlighting the positive effects of chess on the development of their children. Parents also considered
                that chess helped their children develop positive emotions and helped them overcome negative emotions.
                The results revealed differences between the opinions of parents depending on whether they know how to
                play chess or not. Thus, parents who do know how to play chess were more likely to focus on the positive
                effects of the game on the development of their children, and those who know how to play chess were also
                more satisfied with their children’s accumulated knowledge following chess lessons.

                knight), and the king are all on the last row of a chess board.
                The rooks occupy the corner squares. Next to the rook is a knight. The bishop takes the other square
                next to the knight. The queen is always placed on her color (white queen on white square), and the king
                is placed next to her.
                Your eight pawns occupy the next row all in a straight line. Your opponent’s pieces reflect the same
                positions as yours, including the queen that occupies a square that matches her color.

                Any pawn may move but the strongest initial moves by pawns are by the middle ones to control the center
                of the board. In addition, a knight may move. Because the other pieces are blocked by the line of pawns,
                they may not move yet. Before we discuss opening moves more, let’s get to know each piece and how it
                moves.

                I’m a chess player and a chess dad and a children’s chess coach. I’m lucky enough to teach chess to
                about 300 students in my school during the year. I have many firsthand accounts of the benefits of chess
                for children, both academically and socially, and the results often leave me inspired and reinvigorated

                Academically, we aren’t just talking about math improvement, as sas some people mistakenly
                assume.Studies often show improvement in all academic areas - math, English, reading, science, and so
                on. The reason for this is that chess doesn’t directly teach us math - chess improves our executive
                functions. Chess gives children better control of their own brains - more organized thoughts, better
                planning, better visualization, and better focus. These are skills that can be used on anything. The
                result is more efficient and effective learning in general.

                A Toddler's Guide to Chess
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you, like me, are a small child living in a house with a chess set, you'll know that nothing delights
                your parents more than your showing an interest in the game. What follows is a synthesis of all I've
                learned about chess, which I hope you, like me, find to be a great way to expand your mind, bond with
                your family, and delay the specter of your inevitable upcoming bedtime.
                The Pieces
                NO ONE must touch the pieces but you. This is a fairly simple point, so WHY do I find myself explaining
                it AGAIN and AGAIN?
                Now that that’s out of the way: the queens and the kings are married. White and black pieces MUST NOT be
                allowed to co-marry or fraternize, no matter how uncomfortable this fact makes your parents.
                The queen travels around the board very fast, knocking over the other pieces, sometimes singing “Let It
                Go” from Disney’s Frozen.
                The king never moves, and speaks only ever to say one word: “poopoo.” He’s a very funny part of chess,
                very witty and celebrated.
                Horsies gallop erratically, neighing and whinnying VERY loudly. Remember: it’s not chess if there aren’t
                lots of loud horse sounds.
                The pawns are the babies. To put them in the yogurt is to end the game abruptly and to be taken to bed
                immediately. And yet, in the yogurt is where they must go… One of the delightful contradictions of
                chess!
                The castles can (and must) be stacked.NO ONE must touch the pieces but you. This is a fairly simple
                point, so WHY do I find myself explaining it AGAIN and AGAIN?

                How to Teach Chess to a 2-3 Year Old Little Girl
            </h2>
            <p>
                Hi guys posting this asking for help on how to make it easier for my 2 year and half year old sister to
                learn chess. She asks me to play chess with her every single day, the only issue after I get the board
                and we start setting up pieces she gets distracted very easily. It's been a week since I started
                teaching her chess, so far she kinda know how to setup the chessboard (sometimes small mistakes) and
                also same with the rook movement, it's not very easy for her, which frustrates me, especially when I
                keep asking her "How does the rook move?" and she either doesn't wanna move the piece or distraacted
                playing with another piece or another toy. Sometimes I lose my temper when trying to teach her and once
                I notice she isn't focusing at all I just pick up the board and pieces and tell her to do something
                else, that way I don't force it on her to the point where she starts hating chess. For you guys who have
                exoerience with teaching 2-3 years old chess, is this normal? the focus problems? And what should I do
                to make the learning process optimal?

                chess.
                Your fears are confirmed; your child has been playing blitz throughout dinner, talking about "blunders"
                and "forks" (not the ones on the table), and asking if they can sign up for a "FIDE rating." All
                weekend, you hear "chat, then we go here, takes, takes, takes, here, no no no chat, here, then you grab
                the juicer chat, it's so obviously winning chat," coming from their laptop. You've decided it can't be
                put off any longer... you need to talk to your child about chess.
                Reassure Your Child
                Developing an interest in chess is perfectly natural, and your child needs to know that. You remember
                your first checkmate, your first heartbreak (a loss from a completely winning position), and your first
                tournament. Your naive fascination for one of the oldest board games on Earth developed into a
                meaningful life-long relationship, through hardship and victory, and now it was time for your child to
                discover this wonder of life for themselves.

                discover this wonder of life for themselves.
                When you talk to your child about chess, make sure not to confront them. Don't make them feel shameful
                about their new obsession with tactics or GothamChess recap videos. Encourage them to explore chess in a
                healthy, informed way. Sit down across from them with a chess board and talk through tactical themes,
                explain your own excitement for chess, and help them to make a ChessKid or Chess.com account (depending
                on their age).t just talking about math improvement, as some people mistakenly assume. Studies often
                show improvement in all academic areas - math, English, reading, science, and so on. The reason for this
                is that chess doesn’t directly teach us math - chess improves our executive functions. Chess gives
                children better control of their own brains - more organized thoughts, better planning, better
                visualization, and better focus. These are skills that can be used on anything. The result is more
                efficient and effective learning in general.

                The game of chess is extremely good exercise for our brains. And there’s really no better time for this
                exercise than when our brains are growing and all the wires are being connected. In other words - chess
